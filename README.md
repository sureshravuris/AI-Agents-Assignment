## Projects Overview

### 1. Math Quiz Agent

The Math Quiz Agent is a Python application designed to generate and administer a quiz consisting of basic arithmetic questions. It dynamically creates questions involving addition, subtraction, and multiplication, providing users with a fun and interactive way to practice their math skills.

- **Features**:
  - Generates random math questions.
  - Tracks the user's score.
  - Provides immediate feedback.

### 2. Weather Informer Agent

The Weather Informer Agent simulates a weather reporting tool that provides weather conditions for any given location. Though the data is randomly generated, this agent demonstrates how an AI system could fetch and report weather data to users.

- **Features**:
  - Simulates weather condition retrieval.
  - Reports weather conditions and temperature.
  - Demonstrates potential integration with real-world weather APIs.

### 3. Agent Types with LangChain in Colab

This Colab notebook explores various agent types using LangChain, offering a deeper insight into the capabilities and potential applications of language models within the framework of agent-based systems.

- **Highlights**:
  - In-depth analysis and demonstration of different agent types.
  - Practical examples with LangChain.
  - Exploration of AI agent capabilities beyond simple task execution.
